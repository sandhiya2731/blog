        Pi's journey of survival begins after the shipwreck. Alone in a lifeboat
        with limited supplies and surrounded by the vast ocean, he must endure
        hunger, thirst, storms, and fear. His struggle to survive not only tests
        his physical strength but also his spirit and resilience.
