      <p>
        Pi's adventure is not just physical but deeply spiritual. 
        Drawing strength from Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam, he maintains faith even in the darkest times. 
        His belief in God becomes the guiding light of his survival, turning adversity into a journey of soul and self.
